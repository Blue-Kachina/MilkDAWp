# NOTE: Dependencies are now managed via vcpkg (see vcpkg.json and vcpkg-configuration.json)
# Git submodules have been removed in favor of vcpkg manifest mode for better
# reproducibility, version locking, and simplified onboarding.

# Previous submodule locations (now deprecated):
# - extern/JUCE (JUCE 7.0.12) - now from vcpkg
# - extern/projectm (projectM v4.1.4) - now from vcpkg
